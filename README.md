Note i have little knowledge of esx so i dont know how to do it there but it should be close to it.
Be aware that the ammotype i havent changed what so ever but it has integrated tracer rounds in the weapon so regular pistol ammo doesnt work with it you have to go into the meta and change the weapons ammo type to AMMO_PISTOL or AMMO_APPISTOL


How to install:
1. add the folder to your Resources folder
2. Ensure the folder
3. Make a new item in QB-Core -> Shared -> Items, Make sure that the item type is weapon like shown
(I Suggest Copying a weapon item first like the AP pistol then changing the properties like name and spawn code)
The item Name Should be either Glock_Switch or Glock Switch but the spawn name and Label you can change same with the weight and description.

And thats it now spawn it in it would be in the inventory but if you wanna shoot it and test it out do /setammo amount Glock_Switch or Glock Switch
one of them should work
